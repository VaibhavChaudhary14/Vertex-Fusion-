This prompt integrates the detailed product requirements for Vertex Fusion with the specific design aesthetics and animations inspired by the Lusion website. This document serves as the single, authoritative specification for the development and design teams.🌟 Vertex Fusion: Comprehensive Design & Development SpecificationProduct Name: Vertex FusionProduct Goal: Real-Time GNN-powered Smart Grid Intrusion Detection SaaSDesign Inspiration: Lusion.co (Sleek, High-Performance, Cinematic Dark Mode)Deployment Targets: Frontend on Vercel (Next.js), Backend on Render (Microservices)1. 🎨 UI/UX Design & Aesthetic SpecificationThe design must project an image of technical sophistication, real-time control, and high performance.1.1. Core Theming (SOC/NOC Style)1.2. Animation & Interaction (Lusion Influence)2. 🏠 Homepage (Landing Page) SpecificationThe landing page must be visually striking and communicate the core value proposition instantly, with a focus on performance-driven animation.Reference Visual:3. 🖥️ Dashboard (Primary User Interface) SpecificationThis is the control center. Information must be dense but organized using hierarchy and color.3.1. Real-Time Graph VisualizationTechnology: D3.js or Cytoscape.js, optimized for WebGL canvas rendering.Data Source: WebSocket connection to the Data Ingestion Service.Interaction: Nodes must be clickable. Clicking a node associated with an alert triggers the CP Feature Correlation View modal.State Coloring (Hard Constraint):Healthy: Cyber Green (#00FF00).Anomaly (High Score): Amber/Yellow.Confirmed Attack (Malicious): Alarm Red.3.2. GNN Alert StreamLayout: Fixed, high-priority panel (Left Sidebar).Content: Timestamp, Attack Type (RW, FDI, RS, BF, BD), Confidence Score ($\text{0-100\%}$), and Affected Node ID.Design: Each entry must feature a high-contrast severity badge (e.g., Red badge for Ransomware). Use the monospace font for timestamps and scores.3.3. CP Feature Correlation ViewTrigger: Click event from the GNN Alert Stream or a node on the Graph Visualization.Layout: Split-screen modal view.Content: Synchronized time-series charts showing the anomaly period:Physical Layer: Voltage Magnitude ($V$), Active Power ($P$).Cyber Layer: Packet Rate, Modbus Exception Count.UX: A distinct vertical accent line must be drawn across all charts to mark the exact $\text{Timestamp}$ of the GNN detection event, enabling immediate visual inspection of the feature deviation.4. 🧪 Virtual Lab SpecificationThis module must feel like a powerful, dedicated control interface for emulation.Simulation Control Panel: Clean, bordered input fields and binary toggle switches (Cyber Green for 'ON').Inputs: Dropdowns for Grid Topology (IEEE 14/30/118), Load Profile, and the critical Observability Toggle (Full/Partial).Attack Injection Interface: Minimalist form with fields for Attack Type, Target Node, and Injection Time $t$.Single-Line Diagram: The main visualization canvas. Must be visually precise, using animated lines to show energy flow. Breakers and components should visually switch state (e.g., Red for Open/Tripped, Green for Closed).5. 🛠️ Technology Stack & Deployment5.1. Backend Architecture (Microservices)5.2. Data PlaneUser/Config DB: PostgreSQL (Render Managed Service) for reliability.Real-Time Monitoring DB: InfluxDB (Time-Series Database - TSDB). Must be scalable to handle continuous $\mathbf{X}_c$ and $\mathbf{X}_p$ data streams.Real-Time Bus: Kafka or Redis Pub/Sub for GNN Alert Stream and Graph updates.5.3. AI/ML ImplementationGNN Model: Implement the $\text{Chebyshev-based Graph Convolutional Network}$ using PyTorch Geometric. Model artifact must be stored securely.Chatbot: Use Gemini API with Google Search Grounding. Ensure the internal knowledge base (including the research paper) is prioritized for grounding.LLM Prompt (Recap): "Act as a Smart Grid Cybersecurity Subject Matter Expert... Answer the user's question, citing external web sources (if applicable) and referencing the core GNN detection methodologies... in the GridGuardian platform's documentation."
