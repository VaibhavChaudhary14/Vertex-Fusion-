Here are the key features that can be built into a SaaS product, organized by functional area, drawing directly from the source material:
1. Multi-Modal Cyber-Physical Data Integration and Ingestion
The central innovation of the paper is CP fusion, which necessitates a system capable of handling and synthesizing heterogeneous data streams.
• Physical Layer Data Ingestion: Implement connectors to ingest real-time operational data from the physical power grid infrastructure.
    ◦ Specific Feature Input: Collect and process power system measurements, including active power (P), reactive power (Q), voltage, current measurements, and frequency.
    ◦ Real-time Logging: Store continuous physical measurements in a centralized historian/database (analogous to the ElasticSearch function described in the testbed) for real-time indexing, retrieval, and analysis of system states.
• Cyber Layer Data Ingestion: Implement functionality to collect and process network communication data.
    ◦ Specific Feature Input: Extract relevant network log information such as IP addresses, port numbers, and packet protocol types (which must be handled via one-hot encoding for the model).
    ◦ Packet-Level Capture: Support ingestion of raw network traffic data (like PCAP format) and conversion into a structured format for analysis.
• Data Synchronization and Fusion Engine: A critical background function is the ability to harmonize data collected at different rates.
    ◦ Data Imputation: Implement a robust mechanism to perform a data imputation step, ensuring that every row in the cyber data is matched with a corresponding row in the physical data, overcoming synchronization challenges.
2. Graph Modeling and Topological Representation
The SaaS application must visually and functionally represent the smart grid as a graph structure to leverage the GNN model's advantages.
• CP Graph Definition Tool: Allow administrators to define and visualize the power system as a connected, undirected, weighted graph (G).
    ◦ Node Management (V): Define heterogeneous nodes representing both the physical layer (power substations/buses, generators, loads) and the cyber layer (routers, PLCs, HMIs, servers).
    ◦ Edge Definition (E): Map out the system connectivity, distinguishing between intra-layer edges (transmission lines, network links connecting routers) and inter-layer edges (the coupling links between the cyber and physical components).
    ◦ Weight Assignment (W): Apply weights to physical intra-edges based on line admittance values and binary values for cyber intra-edges and inter-edges (based on adjacency).
• Observability Configuration: Provide settings to define the system's observability status.
    ◦ Partial Observability Mode: Enable a configuration where only a subset of critical physical nodes (e.g., critical loads and generators) are connected to the cyber layer and monitored, mirroring realistic SCADA deployments where full observability is not feasible.
    ◦ Vulnerability Scoring Integration (Advanced): Offer tools or integrations to help determine which nodes are "critical" (e.g., based on electrical metrics like effective graph resistance or topological metrics) to enable effective partial observability monitoring.
3. GNN-Based Attack Detection Engine
This is the core functional feature where the machine learning model operates on the fused CP data.
• Topologically-Aware Intrusion Detection: Deploy the GNN model architecture, utilizing Chebyshev graph convolution layers, designed specifically to capture spatial features and dependencies within the graph-structured data.
• Comprehensive Threat Coverage: The detection system must be trained and deployed to identify a wide range of cyberattacks observed in critical infrastructure incidents.
    ◦ Support detection for advanced threats including Ransomware (RW), Brute Force (BF), Reverse Shell (RS), and Backdoor (BD) attacks (attacks primarily detected using cyber features).
    ◦ Support detection for physical manipulation attacks like False Data Injection (FDI) (attacks primarily detected using physical features).
• Model Deployment Options: Offer the flexibility to deploy different types of detection models:
    ◦ Generalized Detector: A model trained on multi-attack CP data to handle diverse threats, showing strong generalization capability.
    ◦ Attack-Specific Detectors: Models specialized for detecting individual attack types.
• Continuous Learning Integration (Future Feature): Incorporate planned future work, such as online learning or adaptive learning mechanisms, to enable the model to adapt to evolving threats and detect emerging attack patterns without full retraining.
4. Performance Monitoring and Reporting
The application must provide a user interface to display the results and evaluate the efficacy of the IDS.
• Real-Time Classification Output: Provide a continuous binary classification output indicating whether a given sample represents normal operation (benign) or attack conditions (malicious).
• Performance Metrics Dashboard: Display core IDS evaluation metrics to the operator:
    ◦ Detection Rate (DR): Percentage of correctly identified malicious samples.
    ◦ False Alarm Rate (FA): Percentage of benign samples misclassified as malicious.
    ◦ F1-Score: A balanced metric combining precision and recall.
• Anomaly Visualization Tool: A graphical feature illustrating the impact of attacks on the physical layer, such as plotting real-time Active Power (P) samples to visually highlight noticeable deviations induced by cyberattacks compared to normal benign operation.
• Robustness Reporting: Features summarizing the system's performance under different conditions, such as comparisons between detection rates under full observability versus partial observability, highlighting the model's robustness
