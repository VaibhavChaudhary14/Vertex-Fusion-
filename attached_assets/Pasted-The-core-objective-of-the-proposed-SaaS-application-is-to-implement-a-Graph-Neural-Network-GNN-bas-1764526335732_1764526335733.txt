The core objective of the proposed SaaS application is to implement a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based Cyber-Physical (CP) Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for Smart Power Grids (SGs). To make this application more scalable and useful, we must focus on features that enhance its deployment in large-scale, real-world utility networks and address the "Future Works" explicitly mentioned in the source material.

Here are minute details, features, and things that can be added to enhance the scalability and usefulness of your SaaS product, directly supported by the sources:

## I. Enhancements for Scalability and Large-Scale Deployment

The sources explicitly discuss the need to extend the framework to handle systems larger than the IEEE 30-bus model, such as the IEEE 118-bus or real-world utility networks.

| Feature Category | Minute Details and Implementation | Source Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Distributed GNN Framework Integration** | Implement support for **distributed GNN frameworks** to handle the increased computational load and memory requirements associated with large-scale power system graphs. The architecture should allow for parallel processing of graph convolution operations. | The architecture must be extended to more complex systems, such as the IEEE 118-bus or real-world utility networks, by leveraging **distributed GNN frameworks**. |
| **Hierarchical Graph Partitioning** | Introduce modules for **hierarchical graph partitioning**. For massive grids, the system can partition the master graph $G$ into smaller, manageable subgraphs, running detection locally or sequentially, thus improving computational efficiency. | The model can be extended to complex systems by leveraging **hierarchical graph partitioning**. Future work includes extending the framework to large-scale power systems with **distributed computation for efficient processing**. |
| **Hardware Acceleration Optimization** | Optimization layer to utilize specialized hardware (e.g., GPUs or dedicated AI chips) for GNN computation, ensuring **real-time deployment**. The GNN’s use of the **Chebyshev approximation** already aids computational efficiency, but hardware acceleration would maximize this. | Future research could explore **optimization for real-time deployment** in large-scale power systems using **hardware acceleration**. |
| **Increased Data Capacity Leverage** | Design data ingestion pipelines (utilizing ElasticSearch) optimized to benefit from larger datasets. The detection rate (DR) is observed to increase by up to 10% when moving from the 14-bus to the 30-bus system due to the richer dataset, suggesting that handling and leveraging even larger datasets will further improve performance. | The GNN-based IDS achieves higher DRs (up to 6% improvement) in the IEEE 30-bus system compared to the IEEE 14-bus system, attributed to capturing **more spatial features**. |

## II. Enhanced Usefulness and Advanced Detection Features

To make the application more useful, the focus shifts to detecting emerging threats, reducing the need for retraining, and adapting to real-world operations.

| Feature Category | Minute Details and Implementation | Source Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Adaptive/Online Learning Mechanism** | Implement **adaptive learning mechanisms** or **online learning** within the detection engine. This feature allows the model to continuously update its parameters and adapt to evolving threats and emerging attack patterns **without requiring full model retraining**. | Future works include integrating **adaptive learning mechanisms** to detect **emerging attack patterns**. |
| **Slow Injection Attack Detection Module** | Develop a specialized module to evaluate the system's performance against **slow injection attacks**. This module must monitor gradually altered measurements over time to catch stealthy behavior that static models might miss. | An important direction for future work is to evaluate the system’s performance against **slow injection attacks**. These attacks involve **gradually altering measurements over time** to mimic stealthy behavior. |
| **Generalization to Unseen Attack Types** | The system should be capable of **generalization to unseen attack types without retraining**. This requires the generalized detector (which already performs well) to be further optimized to handle unknown malicious activities based on learned graph features. | Future research could explore **generalization to unseen attack types without retraining**. |
| **Attack-Type Identification and Localization** | While the GNN detects *if* an attack occurred (binary classification), future capabilities could enhance the output to include **localization** (identifying *where* the attack is occurring on the graph) and **classification** (identifying *which* attack type it is). | Prior research mentioned in the source discusses a GNN multi-task learning approach for detection and **localization of cyberattacks**. |
| **Robust Hyper-Parameter Tuning Tools** | Provide a comprehensive sequential grid search utility or similar optimization tools within the application setup process to determine optimal hyper-parameters (e.g., number of GNN layers, learning rate, batch size) tailored to the specific grid topology. | The optimal hyper-parameters for the GNN-based IDS and benchmarks were determined using a **sequential grid search strategy**. This approach is necessary due to the high dimensionality of the parameter space. |

## III. Data and Real-World Integration Features

The sources emphasize the need for real-world applicability and realistic data handling.

| Feature Category | Minute Details and Implementation | Source Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **SCADA Protocol Integration Layer** | Implement a layer to natively integrate and ingest data directly from common SCADA protocols (e.g., DNP3, IEC 61850 GOOSE, or Modbus/TCP, as used in the testbed). This moves beyond relying on simple PCAP/CSV file conversion. | Practical deployment may require **integration with SCADA protocols**. Previous works examined protocols like DNP3 and IEC 61850 GOOSE signals. The testbed uses **Modbus/TCP**. |
| **Vulnerability-Based Critical Node Selector** | Provide a utility for defining the "critical loads and generators" used in **Partial Observability Mode**. This tool should use metrics based on the Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP), incorporating factors like: **effective graph resistance**, **load shedding**, **connectivity impact**, and **geodesic vulnerability**. | Critical loads are determined by adopting the approach described in, which uses AHP to weigh **electrical metrics** (e.g., effective graph resistance) and **topological metrics** (e.g., connectivity impact). |
| **Real-time Feature Normalization Engine** | Ensure that the preprocessing pipeline executes feature normalization for numerical features and **one-hot encoding** for the categorical cyber feature (**packet protocol**) in real-time before feeding the attributes to the GNN model. | All features are given to the model as unaltered numerical data except for the cyber feature indicating the **packet protocol where one hot encoding is applied**. |

The enhancement features ensure that the SaaS product transitions from a validated research concept (IEEE 14/30-bus) to a utility-grade system capable of operating in complex, dynamic, and large-scale power environments, while staying current with the evolution of stealthy cyber threats.
